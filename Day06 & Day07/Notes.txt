Welcome to Python (in Tamil) - Day 6
====================================

1. Operators - Arithmetic operators, Logical operators, Assignment Operator, Relational Operators

2. Control Structures
------------------
Control Structures are used to control the flow of execution in a Python program. 

Sometimes, it is required to skip execution of few statements based on the logic and in some cases, a set of statements may be needed to get executed repeatedly for a finite number of times or based on the value of the variable.


If 	-- Executes the statements inside the ‘if’ block, only if the evaluated condition is true. Also called as One-way selection statement.
If-Else 	-- 	Executes the statements inside the ‘if’ block, only if the evaluated condition is true. Else, the statements inside the ‘else’ block are executed.Also called as Two-way selection statement.
Else-If ladder -- 	Executes the statements inside the ‘if’ block, else it goes to the next ‘else if’. If it evaluates ‘True’, the control comes out of the else-if ladder. If ‘True’ is never evaluated in any of the test conditions, the statements inside the else block are executed. Also called as Multi way selection statement.
Nested If  --	An if statement within another if statement is known as nested if statement


Syntax:
-------
if (condition):  ==> TRUE/FALSE
	#block - set of statements
	if(condition):
		#set of codes
	dgf
	dg	
elif(condition):
	#set of statements
	if(condition):
elif(condition):
	#set of statements
elif(condition):
	#set of statements
else:
 	#set o statements

1. Recap
2. Looping
3. Lab session - Operators, Conditional stmt, Looping

foreach in .NET --> for in python

Range function in for loop
1,7
1,2,3,4,5,6 ==> step - 2
1   3   5 

control statements:
-------------------
pass - Nothing to perform
break - to stop the execution of loop 
continue - to move next iteration
